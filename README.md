# farmOS Asset Termination

This module is an add-on for the [farmOS](http://drupal.org/project/farm)
distribution.

It adds the ability to mark any log as terminating referenced assets.

Logs marked as termination will on completion mark referenced assets as
terminated and archive them. A terminated asset page will display
the termination time linked to the log that terminated the asset.

Additionally all termination logs will have assigned 'Termination' log category
for easier log filtering.
